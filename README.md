## Playground

This is my go "scratchpad" or "playground." Where I learn and practice the intricacies of the  Go programming language.
I had a repository called [go-scratchpad](https://github.com/dqfan2012/go-scratchpad). After practicing and learning Go 
for a while, I come to realize that the name of my repository didn't follow the naming conventions for Go modules. I 
created a new repository with a properly named Go module. I'm migrating the code from my original repository to here.
This repo will be my scratchpad/playground moving forward.
