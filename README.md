## Playground

This is my go "scratchpad" or "playground." Where I learn and practice the intricacies of the  Go programming language.
I had a repository called `go-scratchpad`. After practicing and learning Go for a while, I come to realize that the name 
of my repository didn't follow the naming conventions for Go modules.
