# Data Structures Package

## Overview

The `ds` package provides implementations for fundamental data structures in Go, including linked lists (both singly and doubly linked lists) and queues (including priority queues). These data structures are designed to offer efficient and easy-to-use tools for managing collections of elements with dynamic sizes.

## Features

- **Singly Linked List**: Efficient for appending and sequential traversal.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Allows traversal in both directions and efficient element removal.
- **Queue**: Implements a standard first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue.
- **Priority Queue**: A queue where elements are dequeued based on priority.
- **Set**: An implementation of standard sets.
- **Stack**: Implements a standard last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack.

## Installation

To install the `ds` package, use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/dqfan2012/playground/pkg/ds
```
